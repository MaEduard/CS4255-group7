# CS4255-group7
FastTree implementation for the group project of the course CS4255 (TU Delft) by Eduard Ma, Olof Jonnerby, and Georgi Trevnenski 

# How to run the code
Open the src/fasttree.py file which contains the implementation of the FastTree algorithm as described in https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msp077. 
In your preferred IDE, run the src/fasttree.py file and view the final output in the terminal under 'End Test'.
Another option would be to open the CS4255-GROUP7 folder in your terminal and run: 'python fasttree.py'.

If the user would like to view a different data set, this can be specified by changing the parameter in the ```read_file(<path to data set>)``` in the ```main()``` function at the bottom of the src/fasttree.py file.
